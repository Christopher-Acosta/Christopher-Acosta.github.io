                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    I started as a truck unloader at Wal-Mart, before deciding that I wanted to be a truck
                    driver. After graduation from CDL school, I was recruited by Averitt Express, where I have
                    worked for my entire trucking career so far: 9 years.

                    <h3>Professional Truck Driver - Averitt Express</h3>
                    <p><b>April 2016 -</b></p>
                    <p>
                        I've accrued over 900,000 miles of safe driving, delivering freight across the eastern United States. In the course of duty I must work up to 14 hours a day,
                        adapt to multiple sleep schedules and standards of punctuality, inspect my own equipment and ensure that it is safe to operate,
                        establish and maintain cordiality with customers, plan my routes and make adjustments during various traffic situations, verify the
                        contents of all shipments, and be a safe and courteous driver, all while managing my DOT-regulated timers. I have been awarded
                        safe driving awards annually, and received multiple clean random DoT inspection reports. Since 2016, I have not consumed a single drop of alcohol, nor have I had any preventable accidents.

                    <p>
                        Learned professional truck driving etiquette, DOT regulations, and how to drive a 10 speed truck on the highway as well as
                        various backing maneuvers. The cost of CDL tests are covered by the price of admission, and I earned my CDL using equipment provided by the school.

                    <p><b>February 2011 - January 2016</b></p>
                    <p>
                        2nd shift freight handler. I unloaded several trucks every night as part of a team. I was responsible for unloading the truck, sorting the freight,
                        and stacking it on pallets. I was also responsible for coordinating unloads of frozen and grocery trucks with on-the-clock drivers, which have palletized freight suitable for 
                        quick handling. I was taught to use several pieces of specialized freight handling equipment including manual pallet jacks, electric pallet jacks, walkie-stackers
                        and forklifts. When not handling and moving product, I was responsible for counting inventory, stocking shelves, cart coralling, and occasionally the layaway counter where I excelled
                        at defusing disgruntled customers respect, patience and service.

                    <h3>Leslie's Pool Supply Delivery Driver</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was one of 5 Averitt Express drivers chosen to serve the Leslie's account. This account was a special account where my duties were
                        primarily to the customer itself, and not Averitt. In service of Leslie's, I pulled Leslie's trailers loaded with pool supplies including large quantities
                        of hazardous chemicals. We had to deliver to extremely small store locations which were often challenging to get in and out of. Our trailers were
                        equipped with lift gates and we unloaded the trailers ourselves using electric pallet jacks. A single trailer could be destined for up to 12 stores across hundreds of miles.
                        Stores were often staffed with only one person, which forced us to emphasize coordination in terms of schedule, and I often called stores in advance,
                        and sometimes even called managers' personal phones to coordinate after-hours or early morning deliveries. I emphasized proper notice, punctuality, respect, and deference
                        and was often told that I was their favorite driver, and I took pride in making friends with notoriously grumpy managers.

                    <h3>Cracker Barrel Delivery Driver</h3>
                    <p>
                        Dispatched out of the Cracker Barrel distribution center in Lebanon, TN. This was another driving assignment where I primarily serviced a single customer,
                        and didn't report to Averitt directly. I delivered to dozens of Cracker Barrel locations across Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
                        Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. I unloaded every trailer myself with a dolly and ramps. Each trailer was packed to the ceiling with hundreds of boxes
                        and it was incredibly physically demanding work.
